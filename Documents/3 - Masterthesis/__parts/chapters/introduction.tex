On today's integrated circuits there is a considerable potential of generating high temperatures, 
due to shrinking devices sizes and increasing frequencies. By the reason that the carrier mobility 
is degraded and the interconnect resistivity increases, the devices could suffer from decreased 
execution speed and longer interconnect delays \cite{Huang2006}. Those soft (timing) errors can 
eventually lead to the premature occurrence of hard errors \cite{Borkar2005}. Finally local hot 
spots and higher temperature gradients can lead to a shortened device life time and a shrinked 
package reliability.


Especially FPGAs can generate local 
temperature hot spots and alarmingly high temperatures are reached within a small area. For many 
cases the accurate temperature monitoring and prediction is becoming increasingly important.
