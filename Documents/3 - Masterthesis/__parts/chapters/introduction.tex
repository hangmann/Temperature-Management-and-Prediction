\section{Motivation}
Nowadays there is a large field of research in thermal effects on \ac{FPGA}\,-based systems. The shrinking device structures lead to dramatically increased thermal effects and high temperatures. This again could have consequences on the \acp{FPGA}. By the reason that the carrier mobility is degraded and the interconnect resistivity increases, the devices could suffer from decreased execution speed and longer interconnect delays \cite{Huang2006}. Those soft (timing) errors can eventually lead to the premature occurrence of hard errors \cite{Borkar2005}. Finally local hot spots and higher temperature gradients can lead to a shortened device life time and a shrunk package reliability. 

Hence, it is increasingly important to accurately monitor and predict the temperature.
