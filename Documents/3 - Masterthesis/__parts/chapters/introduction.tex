\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

On today's integrated curcuits there is a considerable potential of generating high temperatures, due to shrinking devices and increasing frequencies. Especially FPGAs can generate local hotspots and alarmingly high temperature increases with only a rather small resource utilization \cite{Agne2013}. For many cases the accurate temperature estimation and prediction is becoming increasingly important.
